.SH DESCRIPTION
.B free
displays the total amount of free and used physical memory and swap space
in the system, as well as the buffers and cache used by the kernel.
.PP
This is a cross-platform implementation supporting FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
DragonFly BSD, macOS, illumos/Solaris, and Haiku OS.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-bytes
Display the amount of memory in bytes.
.TP
.BR \-k ", " \-\-kilo
Display the amount of memory in kilobytes (default).
.TP
.BR \-m ", " \-\-mega
Display the amount of memory in megabytes.
.TP
.BR \-g ", " \-\-giga
Display the amount of memory in gigabytes.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-human
Show human-readable output with appropriate unit suffixes (B, K, M, G, T).
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-\-help
Display usage information and exit.
.SH OUTPUT
The output is displayed in a table format with the following columns:
.TP
.B total
Total installed physical memory (excluding firmware-reserved memory).
.TP
.B used
Memory currently in use (calculated as total - available).
.TP
.B free
Unused memory (includes memory that can be immediately allocated).
.TP
.B shared
Memory used by tmpfs filesystems (not available on all platforms, shown as 0).
.TP
.B buff/cache
Memory used for buffers and cache. On ZFS systems (FreeBSD, illumos),
this includes the ZFS ARC cache which can be several gigabytes.
.TP
.B available
Estimated memory available for starting new applications without swapping.
.PP
The
.B Mem:
line shows physical memory statistics, and the
.B Swap:
line shows swap space statistics (not displayed on Haiku OS).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success
.TP
.B 1
Error (e.g., unable to retrieve memory information)
